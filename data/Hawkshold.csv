"Hawk Army Ability - Bravery - You may spend a Command Action to give one of your units Bravery by circling its Courage. While a unit has Bravery, it gets Courage +3. If a unit with Bravery fails a Rout Check or passes a Rout Check but would have failed without the +3 bonus, then it loses Bravery. (Erase the Circle.) You may not give Bravery to a unit that currently has Bravery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
