"Dark Elves Army Ability - Pain Touch - You may spend one command action to mark the Pain Touch box on one of your units. When that unit deals one or more damage in an attack, erase the box and your unit deals an additional damage. You can't use this ability on ranged attacks, or if you played a command card on the attack. Premeditation - During army creation, you may spend up to 60 points on Premeditation. After deployment but before writing orders, you may mark the Pain Touch box on one of your units for every 15 points you spent on Premeditation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
